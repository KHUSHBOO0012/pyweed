# List of items to consider

# Installation

* should have a detailed Anaconda .yml environment file for setup on a clean machine

# Code overall

* need many more try/except blocks especially for fdsn requests
* all error messages from fdsn services should be logged
* some error messages should cause user-friendly status messages to appear in the GUI
* clean up columns needed/used for eventsDF and waveformsDF and GUI tables
  (original columns came from IRIS format="text" requests)
* lots of code to write to validate parameters for and parse results from 
  different FDSN dataCenters

# GUI overall

* more extensive use of stylesheet
* when other dataCenters are supported, add a dataCenterComboBox at the top of the main page.
  (separate comboBox for each of events/stations/waveforms ?)

# Preferences

* more preferences for various default settings throughout the GUI, e.g. dataCenter
* new preferences dialog -- for viewing, changing and saving default preferences

# Seismap

* handle branch cut/boundary issues
* explore use of python-qgmap: https://github.com/vokimon/python-qgmap

# Station/EventOptions

* consider putting all station/event options in a single dialog (some options interact)
* enable "during operation of selected ..."
* enable "distance from selected ..."

# Station/Event Handlers

* optimize for IRIS by returning older requests with format="text" and simple pandas parsing

# Waveforms

* deal with behavior issues that arise after testing by real users
* toggle checkboxes by clicking anywhere on a row (enable selection but disable highlighting)
